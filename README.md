A performant and flexible standalone "third-eye" targeting resource, with additional functionality for supported frameworks.

ox_target is the successor to qtarget, which was a mostly-compatible fork of bt-target.
To improve many design flaws, ox_target has been written from scratch and drops support for bt-target/qtarget standards, though partial compatibility is being implemented where possible.
